Revision history for Path-Dispatcher

0.07
        Paths are now boxed with the new Path::Dispatcher::Path.

        New rule type "Intersection" which matches only when each of its
        subrules match.

        New rule type "Metadata" which matches the optional metadata (a hash)
        of the path.

        New rule type "Eq" which just does basic string equality.

        Rules can now be named. In Path::Dispatcher::Declarative, each rule is
        named with its dispatcher's name and the file:line where the rule was
        defined.

        Dispatch tracing output, for debugging. Set environment variable
        PATH_DISPATCHER_TRACE to a number. The higher the number, the more
        output will be generated. The current maximum value of 10 will dump
        code references.

        New rule type "Empty" which matches only the empty path.

        Declarative:
            on '' now matches only the empty path.

        Improve test coverage
        New rule type "Always" which always matches.

        Match:
            ends_dispatch is now an attribute

        Rule::Tokens:
            Support for case insensitive matching
            Fix for tokens' type constraint

        Dispatcher:
            Allow rules to be specified in the constructor (a typo prevented it)

        Dispatch:
            first_match, has_match methods which do what you'd expect
            The run method will now collect return values and return them

        Declarative:
            redispatch_to sugar which adds a Dispatch rule
            "on '' => sub" as a special case will match all paths

        "rewrite" rules
        Super dispatchers are GONE! Yay.
        New Rule::Dispatch which just takes some other dispatcher. nothingmuch++

        Rule::Tokens:
            Fix for always matching just a prefix whether you wanted to or not
            Make tokenization and untokenization into methods for overriding

        Declarative:
            -base is required, otherwise unrelated modules using your dispatcher
                would get their @ISA set!

        Documentation!
        Prefix matches
        "under" rules
        Remove stages until they're actually needed

        Rule:
            The codeblock is no longer required
            Empty tokens are ignored
            The token attribute is now 'delimiter' instead of 'splitter'
            Allow regexes and alternations in the token rules

        Match:
            No longer Dispatch::Match
            Created by the Rule instead of the Dispatcher

        Declarative:
            You now must subclass Path::Dispatcher::Declarative
            Allow overriding the token delimiter
